Welcome to our session on Running PeopleSoft on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This is a popular topic - both from presenters and customers. We hope to give you some insight on why we made the move to OCI, what learned along the way, and where we want to go.

# Agenda

1. Introduction
1. Pre-Cloud and Migration to OCI
1. Life in the Cloud
1. Second Chances
1. Questions

???

We've got a story to tell today. After I introducde myself and Jeff, we start with:
1. What PeopleSoft was like when we ran it on-site, and our brief experience with OCI-Classic (OPC at the time)
1. We then move into our migration to OCI: what the plan was, how it worked out, and when we moved non-prod, DR, Production to OCI.
1. I want to share somethings about what life is like now that all of PeopleSoft is in the cloud. There are lots of good things; but maybe somethings you didn't think about.
1. We will have a rare second chance to building out PS in the cloud with an upcoming 9.2 upgrade. I'll share what chagnes we'll make to enjoy life in the cloud even more!
1. I'll leave some time for questions at the end; please send the questions in as you think of them!
